# 📸 **FaceMix Polaroid — The Dislocated Emoji Camera**

> A playful fusion of **facial expression recognition** and **artistic visual design**.
> Watch your emotions transform into a quirky Polaroid collage — in real time.

---

## 📖 Overview

**FaceMix Polaroid** is an interactive Python project that blends **computer vision** with **artistic expression**.
Using a webcam, it detects and classifies your facial expression, displaying the corresponding **emoji** floating above your head.

At the same time, it extracts your **facial features** — eyes, nose, and mouth — and reattaches them as **mini Polaroid photos**, slightly misplaced on your face for a surreal yet humorous effect.

When multiple people appear on screen, their facial features are **randomly swapped**, turning every session into a spontaneous visual remix.
You can also **add custom text** to the bottom of the main Polaroid frame and **save the image**.
